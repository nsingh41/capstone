      		<p style="text-align: justify;">  The way we met was actually a happy accident. I had not changed my location settings or my age settings from the default, so Mathew kind of snuck in there, because there's a 13-year age difference and we lived 50 miles apart. So we got a match, but neither of us was really taking it seriously. Mathew messaged me, and we talked a little bit, and just kind of got everything big, all of our baggage, out right away so we could see if it was even worth continuing to talk. I gave him my phone number and he texted me, "Hi, Vanessa, it's Mathew." And I said: "Which Mathew?" as a joke. And that was it. We just talked nonstop from that point, and we went on our first date a week later. We went on a hike, and we put wine in water bottles and had a little picnic at the end of the hike.

      		<p style="text-align: justify;"">I signed up for online dating with a friend, almost like signing up for a marathon together. I went on dates with a few guys, and it wasn't good. I was just not into it, and was about to quit, but then I saw this guy. I'm 5-foot-10, and I've always had a thing about height, and I saw this guy with a really sweet, open face, and he was 6-foot-9, I was like, This can't be real. He was a handsome prince and I just dreamt of being the princess same very moment. So, I started texting him on his number and two or three messages in, we found out that we live extremely close to each other, and he was like "Let's meet up." So I finally was like, do you want to come over? And he came over, and we watched "Friends with Benefits", and that was it.  Once I realized that he's the kind of person who says what he means and means what he says, I was so happy. I remember early on, I would say to my friends, "I think he thinks I must be an heiress, he just treats me so nicely." We moved in together after about 18 months of dating. It's going great. Barring something really unpredictable, we both think that this is "It."

      		<p style="text-align: justify;"">Hi, I am Lia here. I am going to tell you about my love life. I still cannot believe that I found my Mr. Right from this web app. It has been 3 years since we are together. So, now how do we met? I was just browsing profiles on find and meet. I liked his profile and send him request. He accepted it two days later and left a message for me saying, ‘hi’. I was online and quickly replied to him. After basic introduction, we decided to meet on the weekend at a coffee shop in the town. On that day, the weather was so romantic and I think that helped us to fell for each other. Later, we started meeting on every weekend. We went for hiking together and get to know each other more. It continued after we both realized that we are made for each other. I want to thank Find and Meet to make me meet to him. I am so happy.
